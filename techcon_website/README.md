# TechCon 2024 Website

This project is part of the ALX Practical HTML course. It showcases a fully functional static website built using only HTML5, representing the official site of the fictional TechCon 2024 technology conference.

## 📄 Project Overview

This website consists of **five main HTML pages**, each highlighting a different aspect of the conference:

- `index.html` – Homepage introducing TechCon 2024 with navigation links and a promotional video.
- `about.html` – About page describing the history, mission, and past speakers of TechCon.
- `schedule.html` – Schedule page presenting a detailed conference timetable in tabular format.
- `register.html` – Registration page with a form for attendees to sign up.
- `contact.html` – Contact page with official email, social media links, a Google Map embed, and a contact form.

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

- Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Form inputs (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<label>`, etc.)
- Navigation using `<nav>` and `<a>` tags
- Embedding multimedia: `<video>` and `<iframe>`
- Accessible HTML structure
- Table creation with `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, and `<caption>`

## 🚫 Restrictions

- No CSS or JavaScript
- No external frameworks or libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, React, etc.)
- HTML-only, as per ALX project requirements
